# CTF/Cyber Security Scripts and Tools 

These are tools that are designed for specific set of CTF Chalenges/Cyber Security practices. If you want to contribute, here is how you should do it:

1) Create a separate branch and an issue regarding what you are making. This is to avoid duplicate scripts being made. If it is unique/improvement of an exisiting tool, we will approve it. 

2) Write your tools. Make a separate folder for each tool and create a README for it too. Add the following header to the top of your tool.

  - For python-like code
```python
#Author: Name
#Contributors: Name1, Name2 (leave blank if no additional contributors)
```

For C-Like Code
```C
/**
  * Author: Name
  * Contributors: Name1, Name2 (leave blank if no additional contributors)
  */ 
```

3) Create a pull-request. DO NOT INCLUDE BINARIES!!! We will reject it if it includes binaries. Solely include code and compilation details if necessary (should be included in README).
